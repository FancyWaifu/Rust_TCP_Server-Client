Very simple TCP server/client in Rust

This program is more for future reference when I want to implement bigger and better stuff

Dependency:
Client folder - easyinput

How to run:
1) Run command "cargo new tcp_server"
2) Run command "cargo new tcp_client"
3) Put the server.rs file into the tcp_server src file
4) Put the client.rs file into the tcp_client src file
5) To run, go into each folder in the terminal and run "cargo run"
